# Parking Lot Management System Development for Web System Development subject

This is the project done by me and my partner - Nguyen Huu Nghia (huunghia040603). We are introducing a system which can manage all data from a real-life parking lot.

We chose:
- Spring Framework for creating back-end including admin management and APIs for interacting with server.
- ReactJS for creating user interface.

This project contains some features like:
- Searching parking lot by address.
- Reserve a parking space in a parking lot.
- Pay a reservance (still develop).
